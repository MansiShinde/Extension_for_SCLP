# Extension_for_SCLP


Extending SCLP to support more language features Research Project
Done under the Guidance of Dr. Uday Khedker, Professor of Computer Science Department, IIT Bombay 
Tech Stack: C++, flex, bison, g++, make, glr parser

● SCLP is a Language Processor developed in an incremental fashion by Dr Uday Khedker in order to help UG students understand the compilation process in a better way. Development of the project started with designing a compiler for declarative statements and then enhancing it using well-defined increments

● I contributed to this project by enhancing the existing SCLP compiler to support advanced features of object-oriented programming like classes, objects etc.

● Outcome: Compiler was able to perform syntax and semantic analysis, generate Abstract Syntax Tree for classes and objects.
