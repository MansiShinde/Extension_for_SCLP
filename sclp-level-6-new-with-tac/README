This directory contains the implementation of sclp.

The compiler can be built by giving the command 

	`sh build.sh -lLEVEL -pPHASE' 

where LEVEL is one of the L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5; and PHASE is 
one of the scan, parse, ast, tac, rtl, and asm. For more details, 
see the comments in main.cc and versioning.hh.

Multiple compilers can be built by modifying the build-levels.sh script.

Different options of the generated compiler can be found by giving
the command `./sclp -help'.

The grammar can be extracted by giving the command `sh extract-grammar.sh'.

Regression testing can be done by giving the command `sh check-compiler.sh'.

The banner can be updated by editing `substitute-banner-lines.awk' and then 
giving the command `sh update-banner.sh'.
