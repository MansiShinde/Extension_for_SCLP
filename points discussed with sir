1. sclp - understanding of basic construction of sclp
2. ast
3. icode
4. lex
5. yacc



1. detailed understanding of ast and icode of different programs using sclp
2. drawing class diagrams - connecting the classes using the code
3. practice lex and yacc using 3 tasks - basic calculator, extended calculator for assignments, extended calculator for complex numbers
4. parsing and scanning detailed understanding - shift reduced parsing 


program ---> set of procedures ---> set of statements ---> set of asts ---> set of icodes ---> print assembly language


Problem Statements 

1. developing control flow graphs and ssa and optimizing them for sclp

2. developing sclp for classes, dynamic memory allocation, structures - atleast till asts and icodes
