# Extension_for_SCLP

Extending SCLP to support more language features Research Project / Prof. Uday Khedker / IIT Bombay 05/2019- 06/2020 C++, flex, bison, g++, make, glr parser

● SCLP is a Language Processor developed in an incremental fashion by Dr Uday Khedker in order to help UG students understand the compilation process in a better way. Development of the project started with designing a compiler for declarative statements and then enhancing it using well-defined increments
● I contributed to this project by enhancing the existing SCLP compiler to support advanced features of object-oriented programming like classes, objects etc.
● Outcome: Compiler was able to perform syntax and semantic analysis, generate Abstract Syntax Tree for classes and objects.
